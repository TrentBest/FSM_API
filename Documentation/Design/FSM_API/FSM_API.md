### FSM_API: Foundational Behavior Logic

The **FSM_API** is the core component of the MyVR architecture, providing the foundational behavior logic for all digital experiences. It is built upon the principles of Finite State Machines (FSMs), allowing for a clear and structured approach to managing complex interactions and states within applications.

#### Key Features

- **Decoupled Logic**: The FSM_API separates behavior logic from the underlying platform, enabling seamless deployment across various environments.
- **Reusable Patterns**: By encapsulating common behaviors within FSMs, the API promotes reuse and consistency across different applications.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale effortlessly, accommodating a wide range of use cases from simple interactions to complex, multi-layered experiences.

#### Technical Details

- **State Management**: The FSM_API provides robust state management capabilities, allowing developers to define and control the various states an application can be in.
- **Event Handling**: The API includes a powerful event handling system, enabling responsive and dynamic interactions based on user input and other triggers.
- **Integration**: The FSM_API is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the MyVR architecture, including the Unity Ecosystem and Cloud Infrastructure.
