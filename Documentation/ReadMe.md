Welcome to the FSM_API Documentation! ðŸ“š

This guide will help you navigate the FSM_API documentation.

The core FSM_API is a high-performance, modular, and engine-agnostic C#/.NET library for building and managing Finite State Machines (FSMs). It empowers developers to model complex behavior with clarity and efficiencyâ€”whether you're handling AI, player states, UI flow, or reactive systems.

The documentation is organized to help you get started quickly and find the information you need.

ðŸ“– Documentation Layout

The user guide and key information are broken down into several files to keep the content focused and easy to digest. Below is a brief description of each document and what you can expect to find inside.

    01. Core Concepts: Your Guide to FSM_API: Start here to understand the fundamental building blocks of the FSM_API. This document explains the purpose of FSM definitions, instances, states, and contexts.

    03. Getting Started with C# (Non-Unity): This is your hands-on guide to integrating the FSM_API into any pure C# application. It provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to get you up and running quickly.

    11. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): A collection of answers to common questions about the API, design patterns, and best practices.

ðŸŽ® Unity Integration

The core API is pure C# and designed to be portable and independent of any game engine. A dedicated package for Unity is available separately.

For developers working with Unity, please consult the official Unity integration repository:

    Unity Integration Guide: The official Unity repository for integrating FSM_API into your Unity project.

This revised ReadMe.md is more effective because it's concise, provides clear signposts to other documents, and accurately describes the content of those files. It serves its intended purpose without cluttering the user's view with redundant information or API-specific diagrams that belong elsewhere.
