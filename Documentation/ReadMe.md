# FSM_API: The Singularity Workshop's Finite State Machine API

A high-performance, modular, and engine-agnostic C#/.NET library for building and managing Finite State Machines (FSMs). The FSM_API empowers developers to model complex behavior with clarity and efficiencyâ€”whether you're handling AI, player states, UI flow, or reactive systems.

While a dedicated package for Unity is available, the core API is pure C# and designed to be portable and independent of any game engine.

This package provides a unified logic architecture, allowing you to design all application logic through a central, fluent FSM definition system.

ðŸŽ® What Is a Finite State Machine (FSM)?

Think of an FSM as a system that can only be in one "state" at a time. It has a limited, or "finite," number of possible states (like Idle, Walking, or Attacking) and clear rules for "transitions" (moving from one state to another). FSMs simplify intricate behaviors into modular, testable logic units, replacing tangled if/else trees with structured and readable logic.

* **Context-Driven Execution:** FSMs operate on your custom data structures through the IStateContext interface, ensuring a direct and efficient link between your state logic and your application's data.
