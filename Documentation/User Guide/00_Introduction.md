## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to FSM_API!

FSM_API is a powerful, performance-driven library designed to help you easily manage complex behaviors in your applications and games using **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**. It provides a robust and flexible framework for defining, managing, and executing state-based logic.

<em>At its core, an FSM is a simple concept we see every day. A light switch has two states, 'On' and 'Off', and a clear action, 'flipping the switch', causes a transition between them.</em>

## ðŸŽ® What is the UnityIntegration?

> **Note:** This FSM_API project is a pure C# library and is completely engine-agnostic. It does not include any Unity-specific code or dependencies.

Unity integration is available as a separate package, which provides the necessary bridge for using FSM_API within Unity projects. If you are looking to use FSM_API in Unity, please see:

**[FSM_API_Unity GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TrentBest/FSM_API_Unity)**

All Unity-specific documentation and examples are maintained in that repository. This documentation focuses on the core, engine-agnostic FSM_API.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why and Where Can You Use FSM_API?

FSM_API can be used anywhere you need structured, predictable, and maintainable state-driven logic. Its applications span numerous domains:

    Application & System Logic: Manage complex workflows like a document moving from Draft to Review to Published. Control UI states, such as enabling or disabling form elements based on user progress. Build robust data processing pipelines or manage the lifecycle of network connections.

    AI & Agent Behavior: Define the logic for any autonomous entity, whether it's an enemy in a game (Patrolling, Chasing, Attacking) or a robot in a warehouse (Charging, Fetching Item, Returning to Base).

    Interactive Systems: Control the states of any interactive object, such as a door (Open, Closed, Locked) or a vending machine (Idle, Awaiting Selection, Dispensing).

Its benefits include:
* **Performance-Driven:** Designed for **efficiency** and **responsiveness**, even when managing **hundreds or thousands** of active state machines.
* **Clarity & Maintainability:** Designed for **readability and elegance**, FSM_API helps teams collaborate with ease and maintain codebases confidently.

</a>
<em>Transform tangled logic into a clear, manageable flow.</em>
* **Testability:** FSM_APIâ€™s clean **separation of logic and context** makes it easy to write **automated unit tests** for your state machines.
