  summary: >-
    Base interface for all fundamental context objects within The Singularity Workshop's API ecosystem.

    <p>

    This interface provides a common contract for any object that needs a unique name for identification,

    debugging, or management purposes across various systems, including but not limited to Finite State Machines.

    It serves as a foundational building block, allowing for consistent naming conventions for entities

    that are processed, tracked, or referenced by higher-level abstractions.

    </p>

    <p>

    While primarily used as the base for <xref href="TheSingularityWorkshop.FSM_API.IStateContext" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> within the FSM API,

    <code>IContext</code> is designed to be more general. It lays the groundwork for future modular components

    (e.g., "Atomic" operations, processing units, or other managed entities) that require

    a common identity but may not necessarily involve state transitions.

    </p>
  remarks: >-
    Implementing <code>IContext</code> ensures that an object can be easily identified and referenced

    by name within diagnostic tools, logs, or management interfaces, promoting clarity and traceability

    throughout your application.

    Gets or sets the unique name of the context object.

    This name is used for identification, debugging, logging, and potentially for grouping or lookup

    within systems that manage collections of contexts.
